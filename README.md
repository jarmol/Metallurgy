The user can enter the chemical composition to the elements shown in the table.

The calculator is dynamic, i.e. it will recalculate the new results immediatelly as soon as any element content is changed.

## The calculated results

1. ferrite number acc. to Shaffler Delong

2. Md30 temperature acc. to Nohara

3. Pitting corrosion resistance.

The calculated results are shown under the table.
